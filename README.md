# Design Projects

I've recently got into watching [Hyperplexed](https://www.youtube.com/@Hyperplexed) and decided I wanted to do something like what he does.

I've decided I'm going to pick a website and do two things to it.  I'm going to recreate the website as best as I can and then I'm going to improve it in another section.

I'm going to keep a list of the projects listed in here for easy access and describe them hopefully like little blog posts

### Project 1
## Amazon

I have decided to take this one on first as I know it's something I've seen many times and thought "Wow that's really outdated.  I've taken screenshots of the site to compare to later on
